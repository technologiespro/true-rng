# True Random Number Generator based on game theory 

This document presents an algorithm for generating real random numbers based on the SmartHoldem Blockchain and game theory.

Proof of getting a time-independent random number, also for time travelers.

With tRNG it is possible to get real random numbers, independent of time and knowledge of the result in the future.

those. if you come back from the future knowing the result of a random number and select it, the result of the final random number will change,
because you will influence your choice on the past random number and the chain of events, the past value will change and become completely different,
thus, this algorithm generates real random numbers and protects against time travelers from the future.

## Implementation and usage examples:

Example. Let's take a lottery with 100 tickets with values from 0 to 99.
After all tickets are purchased, a lottery draw takes place.
